[![Build Status](https://github.com/spotify/heroic-client-java/workflows/JavaCI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spotify/heroic-client-java/actions?query=workflow%3AJavaCI)

> a java client for the heroic TSDB

The client supports synchronous and asynchronous paradigms and uses okhttp to make the http requests.

Status: **experimental** api is subject to change!

## Quick start


### Installation

Get the latest version from the release page.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.spotify.heroic</groupId>
  <artifactId>heroic-client</artifactId>
  <version>${heroic-client.version}</version>
</dependency>
```


### Building a Query

There are three main components of a Heroic query.

1. time range.
1. filters to match time series.
1. aggregations on how to combine and group time series.


Let's build a query that will return the requests per second for each endpoint for the artist microservice and group by the region. 

What we will do is...

1. query for 1 hour worth of timeseries.
1. filter for timeseries that match the given key + tags.
1. apply two aggregations with a 60 second bucket. first one downsamples points within the bucket using the average function. the second groups the timeseries by the region tag.


```
final HeroicClient client = HeroicClient.create("http://heroic");

final MetricRequest request = new MetricRequest.Builder()
    .withRange(Relative.withTime(TimeUnit.HOURS, 1L))
    .withFilter(KeyTagFilter.of(Key.of("apollo"),
        List.of(
            Tag.of("what", "endpoint-request-rate", Operator.MATCH),
            Tag.of("stat", "1m", Operator.MATCH),
            Tag.of("application", "artist", Operator.MATCH))))
    .withAggregation(
        GroupingAggregation.forEach(new Average(Sampling.withTime(TimeUnit.SECONDS, 60))))
    .withAggregation(
        GroupingAggregation.groupBy(List.of("region"), new Sum(Sampling.withTime(TimeUnit.SECONDS, 60))))
    .build();


// blocking call
final MetricResponse response = client.queryMetricsBlocking(request);

for (final ResultGroup.Points series : response.getDataPoints()) {
    System.out.println(series.getTags());
    for (final DataPoint point : series.getValues()) {
        System.out.println(point.getTimestamp() + ":" + point.getValue());
    }
}


// or make an async call
final CompletableFuture<MetricResponse> response = client.queryMetrics(request);


```

### Check for Heroic errors & limits

A Heroic query can respond with a 200 status code but have internal errors.

It's up to you as the caller on how you want to progress. For example, if Heroic was running clustered across 3 regions and one of the regions was down `response.hasErrors()` would return `true`, is it okay to act on partial data? 


```
# check if response contains errors
metricResponse.hasErrors();
    
# get the actual errors
metricResponse.getErrors();
    
# check if the response hit any quota limits
metricResponse.hitLimits();
    
# get the actual limits hit
metricResponse.getLimits()
```


## Config

Setting a clientId is useful when used in conjunction with Heroic's querylogs, allowing operators of Heroic to understand who is responsible for the query volume.

```
final Config config = new Config.Builder()
    .setClientId("quota-watcher") 
    .setConnectTimeoutSeconds(30) // default 10s
    .setReadTimeoutSeconds(60) // default 300s
    .build();

final HeroicClient client = HeroicClient.createWithConfig("http://heroic", config);

```

# Releasing

Releasing is done via the `maven-release-plugin` and `nexus-staging-plugin` which are configured via the
`release` [profile](https://github.com/spotify/semantic-metrics/blob/master/pom.xml#L140). Deploys are staged in oss.sonatype.org before being deployed to Maven Central. Check out the [maven-release-plugin docs](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/) and the [nexus-staging-plugin docs](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager2) for more information. 

To release, first run: 

`mvn -P release release:clean  release:prepare`

You will be prompted for the release version and the next development version. On success, follow with:

`mvn -P release release:perform`
